# Etch-a-Sketch

I've built a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## Features:

1. Clear button to clear pad

2. Random Color Generator:generated random color instead of the deafault white one when hovered.

3. Many more features to come like reverting to white rather than random color and etc.
